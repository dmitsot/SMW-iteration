# An iterative method based on Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury regular splitting for nearly circulant matrices

This contains a Python implementation of an iterative method for nearly circulant matrices based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury regular splitting.

A nearly circulant matrix $A$ is a matrix that can be written in the form $A=M-N$ where $M$ is circulant and $N$ such that $\rho(\bM^{-1}\bN)<1$.
